/**
 * CLI Command Wiring Regression Test
 *
 * Ensures every command file in packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/
 * has a corresponding import in cli-entry.ts. Prevents the class of bug
 * where commands are fully implemented but never wired into the CLI router.
 *
 * See: #224 (upstream), #236 (watch), #237 (6 more unwired commands)
