# What's New

Release highlights for Squad — from beta through the v1 TypeScript replatform. For the complete release history, see the [repository changelog](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

---

## v1.0.1 — Planned patch (unreleased)

- **Health routing validation** — The merged [#2165 fix](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad/pull/2165) lets `squad health` accept registered `persistent_name` values such as `Frontend Lead`, as well as registry IDs. Unknown routing references still fail validation.
- **Availability** — This fix is merged into `dev`, but v1.0.1 is not released. Published v1.0.0 does not include it. Keep installation and `SQUAD_CLI_VERSION` activation pins on a published release; do not pin them to v1.0.1 yet.

## v1.0.0 — Current release

The [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad/releases/tag/v1.0.0) is available. The Squad CLI and SDK npm packages graduate to stable 1.0.0. This is a stabilization release, not a guarantee that every older SDK integration is source-compatible.

- **Documentation status** — Removed the blanket alpha disclaimer. Feature-specific limitations and preview/insider channel warnings still apply.
- **SDK dependency floor** — The CLI now declares `@bradygaster/squad-sdk >=1.0.0`.
- **SDK migration** — `ResolvedSquadPaths` adds required `teamSquadDir`; consumers constructing typed objects or test doubles must supply it. Team metadata and `SquadDirConfig` requirements already existed in v0.13.1. Older package/API migrations still require manual application changes; see [SDK migration notes](get-started/migration.md#api-notes).
- **Standalone installation** — GitHub release archives include all six supported platform/architecture bundles and `SHA256SUMS.txt`. See [Standalone Install](features/standalone-install.md) for installation and package-manager availability.
- **Independent package versions** — `Squad.Agents.AI` reached NuGet 1.0.0 separately; the CLI/SDK milestone does not change its versioning policy.

## v0.9.1

- **Shell agent name extraction** — Robust multi-pattern fallback for extracting agent names from shell transcripts (#577)
- **Init scaffolding** — `squad init --sdk` now scaffolds typed casting files; silences remote-lookup warnings (#579)
- **Personal squad global mode** — `squad personal init --global` auto-discovers `~/.config/squad/` (#576)

## v0.6.0 — The TypeScript Replatform

The big rewrite. Everything moved to TypeScript with a clean SDK + CLI split.

- **Full rewrite** — JavaScript → TypeScript with strict mode, ESM modules, Node.js ≥20
- **SDK + CLI split** — Two npm packages: `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` (runtime, adapter, resolution) and `@bradygaster/squad-cli` (commands, shell, REPL)
- **npm workspace** — Monorepo with `packages/squad-sdk` and `packages/squad-cli`
- **Interactive shell** — `squad` with no args launches rich REPL with streaming, welcome banner, session registry
- **OpenTelemetry integration** — 3-layer API (low-level otel.ts, bridge otel-bridge.ts, init otel-init.ts), SquadObserver file watcher, Aspire dashboard support
- **Adapter layer** — `CopilotSessionAdapter` bridging `@github/copilot-sdk` to Squad's session interface
- **Constants extraction** — `MODELS`, `TIMEOUTS`, `AGENT_ROLES` centralized in constants.ts
- **Security** — `execFileSync` with array args replacing `execSync` template strings (CWE-78 fix)
- **Wave-based development** — 3 waves of parallel fan-out:
  - Wave 1: OTel, Aspire, SquadObserver, upstream docs
  - Wave 2: REPL polish, CWE-78 fix, config extraction, 119 new tests, Aspire E2E
  - Wave 3: Docs migration, site engine, 5 guides
- **CLI entry point** — Moved from `dist/index.js` to `dist/cli-entry.js`
- **CRLF normalization** — All 8 parsers normalize line endings; Windows users with `core.autocrlf=true` work correctly

### Breaking Changes (v0.6.0)

| Change | Migration |
|--------|-----------|
| Config file: `squad.agent.md` → `squad.config.ts` | Run `squad init` to generate typed config |
| Team dir: `.squad/` | Standard directory for all team state |
| Routing: markdown rules → typed `RoutingRule[]` | Export existing rules with `squad export` |
| Models: string names → tier-based `ModelConfig` | Use `defaultTier` + `fallbackChains` in config |
