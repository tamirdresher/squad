## Core Context

Docs live in docs/ with blog/, concepts/, cookbook/, getting-started/, guide/, features/, scenarios/ sections. Blog tests use filesystem discovery (dynamic); other sections use hardcoded expected arrays. Microsoft Style Guide enforced: sentence-case headings, active voice, second person, present tense. Docs format: plain markdown, H1 title, experimental warning, "Try this" code blocks, overview, HR, H2 content sections. Scannability framework: paragraphs for narrative, bullets for scannable items, tables for comparisons.

## Learnings

### Blog Post Format
YAML frontmatter: title, date, author, wave, tags, status, hero. Body: experimental warning, What Shipped, Why This Matters, Quick Stats, What's Next. 200-400 words for infrastructure releases. No hype — explain value.

### Boundary Review Heuristic
"Squad Ships It" litmus test: if Squad doesn't ship the code/config, it's IRL content. Platform features used alongside Squad: clarify whose feature it is. Squad behavior/config docs stay. External infrastructure docs (ralph-operations, proactive-communication) → IRL.

### DOCS-TEST SYNC
When adding docs pages, update test assertions in docs-build.test.ts in the SAME commit. When rebasing doc PRs, main branch (already merged) takes priority.

### Contributor Recognition
CONTRIBUTORS.md tracks team roster and community contributors. Each release includes recognition updates. Append PR counts, don't replace.

### Skill Scope Documentation Pattern
Explicitly state what a skill produces and does NOT produce. Deterministic skills prevent agents from generating unnecessary code when templates exist.

### Teams MCP Audit
External tool integrations require explicit "where to get it" guidance. Placeholder paths need clarification that users must provide actual MCP server implementations.

### Cross-Org Authentication Docs
Problem/solution structure for multi-account auth: gh auth switch, Copilot instructions, Squad skill pattern. Cover credential helpers, EMU variations, common error messages. Cross-reference in troubleshooting and enterprise-platforms pages.
