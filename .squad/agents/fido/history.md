## Core Context

Quality gate authority for all PRs. Test assertion arrays (EXPECTED_GUIDES, EXPECTED_FEATURES, EXPECTED_SCENARIOS, etc.) MUST stay in sync with files on disk. When reviewing PRs with CI failures, always check if dev branch has the same failures — don't block PRs for pre-existing issues. 3,931 tests passing, 149 test files, ~89s runtime.

## Learnings

### Test Assertion Sync Discipline
EXPECTED_* arrays in docs-build.test.ts must match filesystem reality. When PRs add new content files, verify the corresponding test arrays are updated. Consider dynamic discovery pattern (used for blog posts) for resilience against content additions. Stale assertions that block CI are FIDO's responsibility.

### PR Quality Gate Pattern
Verdict scale: GO (merge), FAIL (block until fixed), NO-GO (reject). Always verify: test discipline (assertions synced), CI status (distinguish pre-existing vs new failures), content accuracy, cross-reference validity. When detecting CI failures, run baseline comparison (dev branch vs PR branch) to isolate regressions.

### Name-Agnostic Testing
Tests reading live .squad/ files must assert structure/behavior, not specific agent names. Names change during team rebirths. Two test classes: live-file tests (survive rebirths, property checks) and inline-fixture tests (self-contained, can hardcode).

### Dynamic Content Discovery
Blog tests use filesystem discovery (readdirSync) instead of hardcoded arrays. Pattern: discover from disk, sort, validate build output exists.

### Command Wiring Regression Test
cli-command-wiring.test.ts prevents "unwired command" bug: verifies every .ts file in commands/ is imported in cli-entry.ts. Bidirectional validation.

### CLI Packaging Smoke Test
cli-packaging-smoke.test.ts validates packaged CLI artifact (npm pack → install → execute). Tests 27 commands + 3 aliases. Catches: missing imports, broken exports, bin misconfiguration, ESM resolution failures. Complements source-level wiring test.

### CastingEngine Integration Review
CastingEngine augments LLM casting with curated names for recognized universes. Unrecognized universes preserve LLM names. Import from `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/casting`, use casting-engine.ts AgentRole type (9 roles). Partial mapping: unmapped roles skip engine casting.
