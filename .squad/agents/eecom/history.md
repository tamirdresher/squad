### CLI Entry Point Architecture
cli-entry.ts is the central router for ~30+ CLI commands using dynamic imports (lazy-loading). Commands are routed via if-else blocks. Has a recurring "unwired command" bug class — implementations exist in cli/commands/ but aren't routed in cli-entry.ts. The cli-command-wiring.test.ts regression test catches this by verifying every .ts file in cli/commands/ is imported.

### ESM Runtime Patch
Module._resolveFilename interceptor in cli-entry.ts (lines 47-54) patches broken ESM import in @github/copilot-sdk@0.1.32 (vscode-jsonrpc/node missing .js extension). Required for Node 24+ strict ESM enforcement. Works on npx cache hits where postinstall scripts don't run.

### Lazy Import Pattern
All command imports use `await import('./cli/commands/xxx.js')` to minimize startup time. Copilot SDK is lazily loaded only when shell is invoked. All .js extensions required for Node 24+ strict ESM.
