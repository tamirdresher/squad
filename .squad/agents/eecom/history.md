### CLI Entry Point Architecture
cli-entry.ts is the central router for ~30+ CLI commands using dynamic imports (lazy-loading). Commands are routed via if-else blocks. Has a recurring "unwired command" bug class — implementations exist in cli/commands/ but aren't routed in cli-entry.ts. The cli-command-wiring.test.ts regression test catches this by verifying every .ts file in cli/commands/ is imported.

### ESM Runtime Patch
Module._resolveFilename interceptor in cli-entry.ts (lines 47-54) patches broken ESM import in @github/copilot-sdk@0.1.32 (vscode-jsonrpc/node missing .js extension). Required for Node 24+ strict ESM enforcement. Works on npx cache hits where postinstall scripts don't run.

### Lazy Import Pattern
All command imports use `await import('./cli/commands/xxx.js')` to minimize startup time. Copilot SDK is lazily loaded only when shell is invoked. All .js extensions required for Node 24+ strict ESM.

### CLI Packaging & Distribution
`npm pack` produces a complete, installable tarball (~275KB packed, 1.2MB unpacked). Package includes dist/, templates/, scripts/, README.md per package.json "files" field. Postinstall script (patch-esm-imports.mjs) patches @github/copilot-sdk for Node 24+ compatibility. Tarball can be installed locally (`npm install ./tarball.tgz`) and commands execute via `node node_modules/@bradygaster/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js`. Both squad-cli and squad-sdk must be installed together — cli depends on sdk with "*" version specifier. All 27+ CLI commands are lazy-loaded at runtime; `--help` validates command routing without executing full logic.

### Packaging Smoke Test Strategy
test/cli-packaging-smoke.test.ts validates the packaged artifact (not source). Uses npm pack + install in temp dir + command routing verification. Commands are expected to fail (no .squad/ dir) — test verifies routing only (no "Unknown command", no MODULE_NOT_FOUND for the command itself). Exception: node-pty is an optional dependency for the `start` command and MODULE_NOT_FOUND for node-pty is allowed. Windows cleanup requires retry logic due to EBUSY errors — use rmSync with maxRetries + retryDelay options, wrap in try/catch to fail silently since tests have passed.

### v0.8.24 Release Readiness Audit
CLI completeness audit (2026-03-08) confirmed: 26 primary commands routed in cli-entry.ts, all present in smoke test. 4 aliases (watch→triage, workstreams→subsquads, remote-control→rc, streams→subsquads). 3 aliases tested, 1 untested ("streams"). Packaging verified: dist/, templates/, scripts/, README.md in tarball; bin entry points to dist/cli-entry.js; postinstall script included and working. All 32 smoke tests pass. Package.json files array correct. npm pack output shows 318 files, 275KB packed. No missing command implementations. Optional dep (node-pty) handled correctly. Only gap: "streams" alias not in smoke test (routed correctly but test coverage incomplete). Confidence: 95% — all critical paths covered, minor alias test gap non-blocking.

📌 **Team update (2026-03-08T21:18:00Z):** FIDO + EECOM released unanimous GO verdict for v0.8.24. Smoke test approved as release gate. FIDO confirmed 32/32 pass + publish.yml wired correctly. EECOM confirmed 26/26 commands + packaging complete (minor gap: "streams" alias untested, non-blocking).

### Cross-Platform Filename and Config Fixes (#348, #356) (2026-03-15T05:30:00Z)

**Context:** Two cross-platform bugs broke Squad on Windows: (1) log filenames contained colons in ISO 8601 timestamps (illegal on Windows), (2) `.squad/config.json` contained absolute machine-specific `teamRoot` path.

**Investigation:**
- Searched SDK for all timestamp usage in filenames — found `safeTimestamp()` utility already existed but wasn't consistently used
- `comms-file-log.ts` (line 32) used inline `toISOString().replace(/:/g, '-')` instead of utility
- `init.ts` (line 612) wrote absolute `teamRoot` to config.json on every init
- Session-store already used `safeTimestamp()` correctly (line 71)

**Fixes:**
1. **Bug #348:** Updated `comms-file-log.ts` to import and use `safeTimestamp()` utility instead of inline timestamp formatting
2. **Bug #356:** Removed `teamRoot` field from config.json (can be computed at runtime via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)
3. Updated live `.squad/config.json` in repo to remove machine-specific path

**Pattern:** Centralized timestamp formatting in `safeTimestamp()` utility (replaces colons + truncates milliseconds). Windows-safe format: `2026-03-15T05-30-00Z` instead of `2026-03-15T05:30:00.123Z`.

**Test Impact:** All 150 tests pass. Communication adapter test doesn't validate specific filename format (structural test, not behavioral).

**PR:** #404 opened targeting dev.
