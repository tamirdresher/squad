# Decision: Separator component is canonical for horizontal rules

**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Issues:** #655, #670, #671, #677

## What

- All horizontal separator lines in shell components must use the shared `Separator` component (`components/Separator.tsx`), not inline `box.h.repeat()` calls.
- The `Separator` component handles terminal capability detection, box-drawing character degradation, and width computation internally.
- Information hierarchy convention: **bold** for primary CTAs (commands, actions) > normal for content > **dim** for metadata (timestamps, status, hints).
- `flexGrow` should not be used on containers that may be empty — it creates dead space in Ink layouts.

## Why

Duplicated separator logic was found in 3 files (App.tsx, AgentPanel.tsx, MessageStream.tsx). Consolidation to a single component prevents drift and makes it trivial to change separator style globally. The info hierarchy and whitespace conventions ensure visual consistency as new components are added.
