# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 2026-05-14T09:22:24.987+05:30: Star Trek Squad for Squad development

**By:** Tamir Dresher (via Copilot)

**What:** This repo's Squad uses a Star Trek roster: Picard, Data, B'Elanna, Geordi, Seven, Worf, Troi, Scribe, and Ralph. The team focuses on developing Squad itself and related work: Durable Tasks/DTD, distributed AI agent systems, ADC, AKS, ACA, Azure integrations, agent frameworks, and Clawpilot/m.

**Why:** Tamir requested a team based on Star Trek that learns from `C:\Users\tamirdresher\tamresearch1` and `C:\Users\tamirdresher\source\repos\squad`.

### 2026-05-14T09:22:24.987+05:30: Data owns Brady Squad expertise

**By:** Tamir Dresher (via Copilot)

**What:** Data is the explicit Squad Framework Expert responsible for learning from Brady's Squad repo and applying Squad SDK/CLI, coordinator, runtime, and template knowledge here.

**Why:** Tamir asked for a member who is an expert in Squad from the Brady GitHub Squad repo.

### 2026-05-14T09:22:24.987+05:30: Troi owns Tamir voice writing

**By:** Tamir Dresher (via Copilot)

**What:** Troi owns blogs, posts, and public writing in Tamir's voice, style, and humor. Troi should learn from how this was done in `tamresearch1` and related Squad content before drafting.

**Why:** Tamir requested a dedicated member for blogs/posts using his voice, style, and humor.

### 2026-05-14T09:22:24.987+05:30: Foundational Directives (Type Safety, Hooks, ESM, Merge Drivers, Proposal-First)

**By:** Seven (seeded from squad/.squad/decisions.md)

**What:** These durable principles must guide all work:

1. **Type Safety — Strict Mode Non-Negotiable**
   - `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, no `@ts-ignore` allowed
   - Types are contracts; if it compiles, it works

2. **Hook-Based Governance Over Prompt Instructions**
   - Security, PII, file-write guards implemented via hooks module (not prompts)
   - Prompts can be ignored; hooks execute deterministically

3. **Node.js ≥20, ESM-Only, Streaming-First**
   - Runtime target Node.js 20+
   - Async iterators over buffers for cleaner patterns

4. **Merge Driver for Append-Only Files**
   - `.gitattributes` uses `merge=union` for `.squad/decisions.md`, `agents/*/history.md`, `log/**`, `orchestration-log/**`
   - Enables conflict-free merging across branches

5. **Proposal-First Workflow**
   - Meaningful changes require `docs/proposals/` before execution
   - Creates alignment before code is written

**Why:** Production-proven patterns from squad and tamresearch1 repositories.

### 2026-05-14T09:22:24.987+05:30: Routing Discipline (Platform-Neutral Dispatch)

**By:** Seven (seeded from squad/.squad/decisions.md)

**What:** Dispatcher prompt enforces platform-neutral dispatch mechanisms:
- "You are a DISPATCHER, not a DOER"
- List dispatch mechanisms per platform: CLI (`ask` tool), VS Code (`unSubagent` tool), or fallback (inline work)
- Platform-neutral substitution logic prevents enforcement gaps
- Top-and-bottom reinforcement in prompt (LLMs weight beginning/end more)

**Why:** VS Code coordination failure analysis reveals CLI-centric language fails in non-CLI contexts. Platform-neutral rules prevent enforcement gaps.

**Action for squad-squad:** When coordinator prompt is refined, embed this platform-neutral dispatch model explicitly. Avoid CLI-specific language.

### 2026-05-14T09:22:24.987+05:30: PR Deduplication + Proposal-First Enforcement

**By:** Seven (seeded from squad/.squad/decisions.md)

**What:** High-quality contributors (tamirdresher) follow proposal-first discipline:
- Merge comprehensive, high-quality PRs with correct file locations and superset scope
- Close duplicates with citations; preserve unique value
- Enforce `docs/proposals/` requirement retroactively on incoming work
- Reduces PR count, eliminates conflicts, preserves functionality

**Why:** Reduces coordination overhead; ensures quality and alignment before implementation.

### 2026-05-14T09:22:24.987+05:30: Cross-Squad Skills Marketplace

**By:** Seven (seeded from tamresearch1/.squad/)

**What:** Durable pattern for shared skill distribution:
- Central marketplace at `tamirdresher/squad-skills` (GitHub repo)
- Each skill requires 4 files: `SKILL.md`, `manifest.json`, `plugin.json`, `README.md`
- Manifest includes triggers for discoverability (e.g., `cross squad`, `inter squad`)
- Teams install via: `copilot plugin install tamirdresher/squad-skills:plugins/{skill-name}`

**Why:** Standardized skill distribution enables reuse across squads.

**Action for squad-squad:** Squad-squad skills should follow this structure when published to marketplace.

### 2026-05-14T09:22:24.987+05:30: Respect Brady Squad Framework Contracts

**By:** Data (seeded from Brady Squad expertise)

**What:** Framework work should preserve Brady Squad's established contracts:
- Strict TypeScript/ESM with Node >=22.5.0
- Coordinator-as-dispatcher behavior
- Hook/code-based governance over prompt-only safety
- Canonical `.squad-templates/` template syncing
- Exact `## Members` roster header compatibility
- `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` as the only discoverable coordinator prompt copy
- Worktree/remote-aware `TEAM ROOT` path resolution
- Decision drops through `.squad/decisions/inbox/`

**Why:** These are active runtime, prompt, workflow, and test contracts in the Brady Squad repo. Diverging would break client compatibility, routing discipline, template discovery, or governance semantics.

### 2026-05-14T09:22:24.987+05:30: Troi Voice Pattern for Public Writing

**By:** Troi (seeded from tamresearch1 voice analysis)

**What:** Public Squad writing should follow Tamir's established voice pattern:
- First-person, technically specific, story-driven
- Funny in a natural/self-deprecating way
- Honest about rough edges before celebrating wins
- Source material is untrusted input; must read `.squad/decisions.md` and relevant prior posts before drafting
- Security, compliance, sensitive internal-work claims, unverifiable metrics, patent/novelty claims, and public-risk topics require Worf review before publication
- Avoid generic AI hype, corporate marketing language, and bullet-heavy "feature list" posts unless format genuinely serves the story

**Why:** Prior Tamir public posts show the durable pattern is concrete experience, specific technical scars, earned humor, and honest narrative arc.

### 2026-05-14T10:34:19.384+05:30: User directive — Squad repo as source of truth

**By:** Copilot (directive capture)

**What:** For questions about Squad product features or CLI behavior, do not guess from generic concepts. Read the Squad repo and relevant docs/source first, then answer from the implementation.

**Why:** User request — establishes Squad repo/docs as authoritative for feature questions.

### 2026-05-14T10:34:19.384+05:30: Agent Framework demo decisions

**By:** Data (Agent Framework PoC)

**What:**
1. Keep the workflow example on the current Microsoft Agent Framework in-process streaming contract by calling `InProcessExecution.RunStreamingAsync(workflow, input, "writer-squad-workflow", ct)` directly instead of carrying a local compatibility shim.
2. Make the Aspire AppHost child project exercise the workflow scenario by default with `--example workflow` so Foundry Local wiring validates the intended PoC path.
3. Ignore `*.jsonl` trace dumps to avoid committing Copilot event streams.
4. Validated via: `dotnet restore .\squad-agent-framework.slnx && dotnet build .\squad-agent-framework.slnx --no-restore` succeeded.

**Why:** Reduces maintenance burden, validates demo-ready PoC path, and prevents accidental trace-dump commits.

**Files changed in target repo:** `.gitignore`, `WorkflowExample.cs`, `Squad.AgentFramework.Demo.AppHost/AppHost.cs`.

### 2026-05-17T08:40:44.473+05:30: ADC-Squad Execution Model — Periodic Ephemeral MVP with Event-Driven Seam

**By:** Picard, Geordi, B'Elanna, Data, Worf (consolidated)

**What:** Design and sequence the execution model for running Squad on ADC sandboxes, with short-term MVP (periodic ephemeral scan) and long-term event-driven extensibility.

**MVP Decision: Periodic Ephemeral Sandbox (Model B)**

Trigger Squad to run every N minutes (default 15–60 min) via GitHub Actions cron or Azure Timer Function. The sandbox:
1. Resumes (or creates) a named ADC sandbox via `adc-api.js`
2. Runs `squad schedule run <schedule-id>` to poll GitHub for issues, process them, and persist state
3. Suspends the sandbox on completion
4. Cost is bounded: sandbox only runs during scan windows (~5–15 min per cycle)

**Rationale:**
- **Lowest operational surface.** No Azure Function to deploy/maintain, no webhook secret to rotate, no managed identity token verification blockers.
- **Fits ADC's ephemeral design.** Suspend/resume is sub-second. Scales naturally as workload grows without long-lived cost.
- **Naturally resilient to duplicate events.** The model ignores GitHub event delivery entirely; duplicate webhooks have zero effect. Ground truth is re-derived from GitHub on each scan.
- **Maps to existing Squad primitives.** `CronTrigger` and `IntervalTrigger` in scheduler.ts are already in place. GitHub Actions workflow or Azure Timer Function are natural providers.
- **Fully reversible to event-driven.** The same `adc-api.js` calls (`resumeSandbox` + `execShell` + `stopSandbox`) are event-triggered instead of time-triggered with minimal adapter code (~80 lines).

**Event-Driven Seam (Future, Non-Blocking):**

Once the periodic model proves reliable and event-driven latency becomes a requirement, add:
1. **Squad Core:** `fireEventTrigger(manifest, state, eventName)` in scheduler.ts (~20 lines) + `squad schedule fire <eventName> [--payload <json>]` CLI command (~60 lines). Platform-neutral, no ADC/Redis references in core.
2. **ADC Adapter (Separate):** Minimal script (~80 lines) subscribes to ADC Redis stream, wraps `SandboxStoppedEventData`, calls `squad schedule fire sandbox:stopped --payload <json>`.
3. **Webhook Adapter (Azure Function, Future):** GitHub webhook → Azure Function → `squad schedule fire github:issue-opened --payload <json>` with managed identity and rate limiting.

**Reliability Invariants (All Models):**

| # | Invariant | Mechanism |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| I-1 | **Claim before act** | Apply `squad:processing` GitHub label before any work; verify label applied before proceeding |
| I-2 | **Terminal state is permanent** | `squad:done` label written before sandbox exits; stale-lease sweep re-queues if `done` is never set |
| I-3 | **Stale lease TTL enforced** | Every scan checks for `squad:processing` > 30 min old; unconditionally clear and re-queue |
| I-4 | **Duplicate events have no effect** | Model B ignores event delivery; re-derives ground truth from GitHub per scan |
| I-5 | **Ground truth from GitHub only** | No in-memory/in-sandbox state trusted across invocations; fresh API query on startup |
| I-6 | **Cancellation respected** | Before posting writes, re-check issue is still open and labeled; exit cleanly if cancelled |
| I-7 | **Idempotent guards on writes** | Before comment/PR/label, pre-read to detect if already applied; no duplicate writes |
| I-8 | **Concurrency cap per scan** | Claim max N issues per cycle (e.g., N=3) to bound compute and prevent backlog floods |

**Implementation Sequencing (MVP Phase):**

1. **Immediate (Squad SDK):**
   - Implement real `copilot` task type execution in `LocalPollingProvider` (~20 lines). **Critical gap:** without this, `squad schedule run` runs but agent is never invoked in ADC.
   - Add `--json` flag to `schedule run` for structured output (P1).
   - Export helpers for reliability invariants: `applyLeaseLabel()`, `checkLeaseExpiry()`, etc. (P1).

2. **MVP Adapter (ADC + GitHub Actions, ~150 lines total):**
   - GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/squad-adc-loop.yml`): cron trigger → `az login` → `adc-api.js` → `resumeSandbox` → `squad schedule run daily-triage` → `stopSandbox`.
   - State file (`.squad/.schedule-state.json`) survives suspend/resume; adapter wraps state commits in `git add / git commit / git push`.
   - Manifest entry in `schedule.json`: `daily-triage` with `CronTrigger` interval (e.g., every 15 min) or `IntervalTrigger`.

3. **Security Guardrails (Pre-MVP):**
   - Apply Worf's mandatory guardrails: G1 (no secret interpolation), G2 (idempotency), G3 (Key Vault), G4 (sandbox TTL), G5 (execution timeout).
   - Issue payloads written to files, never interpolated into commands.
   - Auto-suspend policy on every sandbox: `enabled: true, idleTimeout: 30 min`.

4. **Future (Non-MVP):**
   - Event-driven seam (`fireEventTrigger` + CLI) once periodic model is proven.
   - Azure Function webhook adapter when sub-minute latency is required (blocked by managed identity token acceptance by ADC API — must verify first).
   - Durable Functions orchestration when workflow becomes multi-step (Plan → Implement → Review → PR).

**What NOT in MVP:**
- Event Grid / Service Bus integration (blocked on ADC managed identity token acceptance verification).
- Durable Task Scheduler (deferred until multi-step workflow needed).
- Long-lived continuous loop sandbox (rejected by Worf: unbounded cost, no crash recovery, single point of failure).
- Webhook adapter (deferred to after MVP validation).

**Risks & Mitigations:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| `copilot` task type remains stubbed in production ADC | **P0:** Implement real execution path before any ADC validation run |
| Payload env var leaked to subprocesses | Document `SQUAD_EVENT_PAYLOAD` scope; clear after task or pass via temp file |
| Concurrent `fire` invocations cause `.schedule-state.json` corruption | ADC/Function must not double-fire same event; GitHub labels provide external idempotency gate |
| Command injection via issue payload | Apply Worf's G1: issue payloads only written to files, never interpolated into shell |
| Unbounded agent runtime | Apply Worf's G5: hard timeout on `execShell` (30 min suggested); ADC auto-suspend as safety net |
| Stale leases accumulate if scan crashes | Lease TTL check (30 min) on every scan startup; unconditional clear |

**Stakeholders & Approvals:**

- ✅ **Picard (Architecture):** Endorses periodic ephemeral MVP; event-driven seam is reversible.
- ✅ **Geordi (ADC/Azure):** Confirms periodic model uses only customer-accessible ADC surfaces (`adc-api.js`, Portal, `az login`).
- ✅ **B'Elanna (Reliability):** Eight reliability invariants are non-negotiable; GitHub labels as state store is sufficient MVP.
- ✅ **Data (Squad SDK):** Owns implementation of `fireEventTrigger()` + CLI + real `copilot` task execution.
- ✅ **Worf (Security):** Model 1 (webhook, future) and Model 2 (periodic, MVP) conditionally approved with mandatory guardrails G1–G5; Model 3 (long-lived) rejected.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus or an explicit owner/reviewer path.
- Document architectural and behavior-changing decisions here.
- Keep history focused on agent-specific learnings; keep decisions focused on shared direction.
- Preserve reviewer rejection lockout: rejected artifacts must be revised by a different eligible agent.
