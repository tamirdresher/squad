# Copilot Coding Agent — Squad Instructions

You are working on a project that uses **Squad**, an AI team framework. When picking up issues autonomously, follow these guidelines.

## Git Safety — Mandatory Rules

**These rules are non-negotiable. Violating them risks deleting production source code.**

### Staging
- ❌ **NEVER** use `git add .` or `git add -A` — these stage unintended deletions from incomplete working trees
- ❌ **NEVER** use `git commit -a` — same risk
- ✅ **ALWAYS** stage specific files: `git add path/to/file1.ts path/to/file2.ts`
- ✅ **ALWAYS** review before committing: run `git diff --cached --stat` and verify the file count matches your intent

### Pushing
- ❌ **NEVER** push directly to `dev` or `main` — always open a PR
- ❌ **NEVER** force push (`git push --force` or `--force-with-lease`) to shared branches
- ✅ **ALWAYS** work on a feature branch: `git checkout -b squad/{issue-number}-{slug}`
- ✅ **ALWAYS** open a PR: `gh pr create --base dev --draft`

### Pre-Push Checklist
Before pushing any commit, verify:
1. `git diff --cached --stat` — file count matches intent (expect ≤10 files for most fixes)
2. `git diff --cached --diff-filter=D --name-only` — NO unintended deletions
3. `npm run build` — build succeeds with your changes
4. Commit message references the issue: `Closes #N`

### Red Flags — STOP and Ask
If you see any of these, STOP immediately and comment on the issue asking for guidance:
- More than 20 files in your diff
- ANY file deletions you didn't explicitly intend
- Changes outside the scope of your assigned issue

## Team Context

Before starting work on any issue:

1. Read `.squad/team.md` for the team roster, member roles, and your capability profile.
2. Read `.squad/routing.md` for work routing rules.
3. If the issue has a `squad:{member}` label, read that member's charter at `.squad/agents/{member}/charter.md` to understand their domain expertise and coding style — work in their voice.

## Capability Self-Check

Before starting work, check your capability profile in `.squad/team.md` under the **Coding Agent → Capabilities** section.

- **🟢 Good fit** — proceed autonomously.
- **🟡 Needs review** — proceed, but note in the PR description that a squad member should review.
- **🔴 Not suitable** — do NOT start work. Instead, comment on the issue:
  ```
  🤖 This issue doesn't match my capability profile (reason: {why}). Suggesting reassignment to a squad member.
  ```

## Branch Naming

Use the squad branch convention:
```
squad/{issue-number}-{kebab-case-slug}
```
Example: `squad/42-fix-login-validation`

## PR Guidelines

When opening a PR:
- Reference the issue: `Closes #{issue-number}`
- If the issue had a `squad:{member}` label, mention the member: `Working as {member} ({role})`
- If this is a 🟡 needs-review task, add to the PR description: `⚠️ This task was flagged as "needs review" — please have a squad member review before merging.`
- Follow any project conventions in `.squad/decisions.md`

## Decisions

If you make a decision that affects other team members, write it to:
```
.squad/decisions/inbox/copilot-{brief-slug}.md
```
The Scribe will merge it into the shared decisions file.
